Logical Model with Redis:

Entities:
1. User
   - user_id (PK)
   - username
   - email
   - password
   - created_at

2. Post
   - post_id (PK)
   - user_id (FK)
   - title
   - description
   - image_url
   - created_at

3. Like
   - like_id (PK)
   - post_id (FK)
   - user_id (FK)
   - created_at

4. Comment
   - comment_id (PK)
   - post_id (FK)
   - user_id (FK)
   - content
   - created_at

5. Redis (Cache)
   - Stores frequently accessed data such as:
     - User session data
     - Popular posts and their like/comment counts
     - Recently added comments

Data Flow:
- When a user requests a post, the system first checks Redis for cached data.
- If the data is not in Redis, it fetches it from the database and stores it in Redis for future requests.
- Updates to posts, likes, or comments are written to the database and also update the Redis cache.

Diagram Representation:

[User] ---> [Post] ---> [Like] ---> [Comment]

- Redis acts as an intermediary to reduce database load and improve response times.
