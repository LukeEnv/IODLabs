The Calculator app is set up using a simple MVC structure. Here's how it works:

1. **Model**:
   - The `Calculator` file in `lib/calculator.js` takes care of all the main calculations like add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

2. **View**:
   - Thereâ€™s no front-end for this app. Instead, it sends JSON responses back to the client, which works as the output.

3. **Controller**:
   - The `calculatorRoutes.js` file is the controller. It sets up the routes and uses the `Calculator` file to handle the logic.

4. **Router**:
   - The `calculatorRoutes.js` file also acts as the router, making sure the right requests go to the right place.

5. **Entry Point**:
   - The `index.js` file is where everything starts. It sets up the Express app, connects the routes, and runs the server.

This setup keeps everything organized by separating the logic, routing, and app initialization into their own parts.
